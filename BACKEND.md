# Python Candidate testing
Back-end - testing cases (Image object detection with transformers)

This test involves evaluating a candidate's proficiency in Python back-end development, particularly in the context of testing cases related to image object detection using transformers. The task entails utilizing the pre-trained model available at https://huggingface.co/TahaDouaji/detr-doc-table-detection to create a Python class capable of predicting on invoice and bank document images. The candidate is expected to write pytest scripts covering various scenarios, including successful extraction and error handling for table extraction on both bank documents and invoice documents.

The idea:
- Use model https://huggingface.co/TahaDouaji/detr-doc-table-detection
- Create a Python Class to to predict on invoice and bank document image
- Write in pytest differents scenarios success extraction or error extraction table on bank document or invoice document
- Use docker container for install package
- Make sure to write the Python test with pytest
- Write ReadME for using

I invite you first to look at our website to learn more about our company dataleon.ai

You can use it to make the request. the documentation is always in English with us!
If the test is conclusive, we will see later for a second interview with the CTO.
